aue <- read_excel("C:/Users/anuhy/Downloads/aus_production.xlsx")
View(aue)

  ylab("Electric production")
#Answer 4A: the plot of this data shows a trend, and a general increase in 
#variation with the level of the series, thus this data needs transforming. 

myts <- ts(aue$Electricity, start = 1956, frequency = 4)
plot(myts)

aue <- na.omit(aue)
aueDiff <- diff(log(myts))
plot.ts(aueDiff)
adf.test(aueDiff)

adf.test(aue$Electricity)
#Answer 4B: the ADF test after taking the log of the time series data concludes that 
#our data is stationary, with a p value of 0.01. ADF test of the original data
#also shows that the data is stationary

#Answer 4C: In order to determine an ARIMA model that may fit this data, we use
#auto.arima. 
auto.arima(aueDiff)
#This returns ARIMA(1,0,1)(2,1,1)[4], or seasonal arima.
#(1,0,1) indicates one autoregressive term, no differencing, and one moving average term
#(2,1,1) indicates 2 seasonal autoregressive terms, degree of seasonal differencing = 1, and 1 MA term
#The 4 indicates quarterly seasonality

#Create Seasonal Arima Model
library(forecast)
modelAue = arima(myts, order = c(1,0,1), seasonal = c(2,1,1), period = 4, include.drift = 'true')
modelAue


#Diagnostic Checks:

aueResiduals = residuals(modelAue)
acf(aueResiduals)
pacf(aueResiduals)
plot.ts(aueResiduals)
gghistogram(aueResiduals)
#ACF and PACF plot of residuals show that they are within the bounds, thus there is little autocorrelation 
#and the residuals resemble white noise.
#Histogram shows a bell curve, thus the residuals are normally distributed
#Mean of residuals is zero, thus the forecast is unbiased.

#Now, we forecast for the next 24 months
forecastAue = forecast(modelAue, h = 24)
forecastAue
plot(forecastAue)

#Accuracy Metrics
tail(modelAue)
accuracy(modelAue)
#The accuracy metrics show low values for ME, RMSE, MAE, and MASE< indicating that
#the forecast is unbiased, and absolute error is low. Thus, this 
#ARIMA model is well fitted to this data.
